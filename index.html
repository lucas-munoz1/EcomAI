							<h2>Accelerating E-Commerce Sales Through<br />
								Real World Data & Machine Learning</h2> 
						</header>
						<p>In the dynamic world of e-commerce, retailers must constantly adapt to ever-evolving challenges, with the most critical of these being the selection and presentation of a profitable product. Our mission is to provide clients with a comprehensive understanding of how customers perceive their products and to identify unmet customer needs that signal new opportunities for growth.</p>
						<p>Leveraging a proprietary e-commerce product analysis engine—which integrates machine learning, data scraping, and advanced natural language processing methods—we offer high quality product intelligence designed to accelerate your e-commerce sales.</p>
					</section>

				<!-- Product Analysis Engine -->
					<section id="Product Analysis Engine">

							<h2>Understanding the Product Analysis Engine</h2> 
						</header>
						<p>The e-commerce product analysis engine is a culmination of data scraping, machine learning models, and natural language processing techniques that are used to analyze e-commerce product’s customer reviews. </p>
						<p>The analysis engine has two primary functions:</p>
						<p class="engine-list-item">1.	To find and exploit market gaps across a product's market <br>2.	To extract high quality product intelligence from customer reviews</p>
						<p>The following sections describe the key components of the engine, and how they relate to the engine's analysis capabilities.</p>
						<!-- TEXT CLASSIFICATION -->
						<h3 class="engine-header">
							<span class="toggle-text">Text Classification</span>
							<button class="engine-toggle">
								<i class="fas fa-chevron-down toggle-icon"></i>
							</button>
						</h3>
						<div class="engine-dropdown">
							<p>The text classification model is a vital component of the analysis engine which uses a pre-trained deep learning model for contextual word embeddings to detect the presence of market gap language within a customer review. </p>
							<p>Market gap language is defined as a customer’s explicit desire for a product feature or capability that is not present in the current product listing. The following example customer reviews demonstrate this type of language:</p>
							<img src="images/Text Class Examples.png" alt="" />
							<p>By strategically applying this model to groups of customer reviews, we can identify consistent gaps in a product's market and develop a detailed plan to help you capitalize on those opportunities.</p>
						</div>
						<!-- SENTIMENT ANALYSIS -->
						<h3 class="engine-header">
							<span class="toggle-text">Sentiment Analysis</span>
							<button class="engine-toggle">
								<i class="fas fa-chevron-down toggle-icon"></i>
							</button>
						</h3>
						<div class="engine-dropdown">
							<p>The sentiment analysis model, a key component of the analysis engine, classifies customer review subtitles as positive, neutral, or negative. This model enriches our analytical capabilities by enabling us to isolate reviews by sentiment, and therefore shift our focus between positive and negative product attributes as needed.</p>
							<p>The following diagrams illustrate the classification process for each sentiment using example customer review subtitles:</p>
							<img src="images/Sentiment Flowchart 1.png" alt="" />
							<p>Neutral serves two main purposes. The first, as demonstrated in the figure above, is to categorize subtitles that have both positive and negative aspects. Secondly, neutral serves as a catch-all for subtitles that lack a clear sentiment.</p>
							<img src="images/Sentiment Flowchart 2.png" alt="" />
						</div>
						<!-- NLP & DATA VIS-->
						<h3 class="engine-header">
							<span class="toggle-text">Natural Language Processing & Data Visualization</span>
							<button class="engine-toggle">
								<i class="fas fa-chevron-down toggle-icon"></i>
							</button>
						</h3>
						<div class="engine-dropdown">
							<p>The final component of the engine is a collection of natural language processing methods, feature extraction techniques, topic modeling algorithms and visualization tools, which allows us to process and interpret large groups of customer reviews.</p>
							<p>This is particularly important, as the amount of data being processed in each analysis is often too large to be reviewed manually. By taking advantage of the engine’s natural language processing (NLP) and data visualization component, we can effortlessly break down groups of text and generate visualizations describing customer language.</p>
							<p>For example, we used the engine to generate a word cloud based on positive customer reviews for a group of fishing vest products, allowing us to visually identify the features customers associate with positive sentiment:</p>
							<img class="special-img" src="images/Wordcloud Example.png" alt="" />
							<p>This word cloud is just one of the many visualization methods available in the engine's text processing and interpretation component, highlighting its ability to interpret large sets of customer feedback through various means.</p>

							<h1>Identifying Profitable Product Characteristics in the Fishing Apparel Market Using Market Gap Analysis</h1>
							
							<h2>The Opportunity</h2>
								<p><a class="data-citation"href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/cmo/toys-hobby/sports-equipment/fishing-equipment/united-states"><strong>‘The United States is currently experiencing a surge in demand for high-quality fishing equipment, driven by a growing interest in recreational fishing among its population.’</strong></a></p>
								<p>In 2024, retailers in the fishing equipment industry face a rapidly expanding market. <a class="data-citation" href="https://worldmetrics.org/fishing-tackle-industry-statistics/">During the Covid-19 pandemic, online sales of fishing tackle products – a subcategory of fishing equipment - grew by 40%. This surge contributed to fishing equipment revenues reaching $1.6 billion in the United States in 2024, a 6% increase from 2023.</a></p>
								<p>To find a product capable of capitalizing on this growth, the product analysis engine was used to analyze thousands of customer reviews for fishing equipment products, and pinpoint a set of specific, solvable market gaps.</p>
							
							<h2>The Solution</h2>
								<p>The primary goal of this analysis was to find a product with a market gap opportunity. To accomplish this, we took advantage of the text classification model in the product analysis engine, which specializes in extracting market gap language from customer reviews.</p>
							
								<h3>Broad Market Gap Analysis</h3>
									<p>First, a broad market gap analysis was employed to find fishing equipment products where large amounts of customer reviews had market gap language. Using the analysis engine to scrape product data, we collected and compared data for products such as fishing gloves, lures, and vests.</p>
									<div class="modal-image-with-text">
										<img src="images/sample-1-fv/Sentiment & MG Distribution Fishing Vest.png" alt="" />
										<p>The product comparisons were made based on statistics generated from the sentiment analysis and text classification models. The primary metrics generated included the average number of positive, negative, and neutral customer reviews for each product category, as well as a 'market gap score,' which represents the percentage of customer reviews with market gap language.</p>
									</div>
									<p>Our first observation was that fishing vests had a significantly higher than average market gap score, at 16.6%. Furthermore, an above-average number of neutral reviews indicated product adequacy, but room for improvement. Based on these two factors, fishing vests stood out as the leading contender for a product with a market gap opportunity.</p>
							
								<h3>Targeted Market Gap Analysis</h3>
									<p>The second component of this process was a targeted market gap analysis for fishing vest products. By repeating the previous process, but for fishing vest subcategories (fly-fishing vests, fishing vest life jackets, etc.), we continued to narrow our focus until we could find distinct market gap opportunities.</p>
									<div class="modal-image-with-text">
										<img src="images/sample-1-fv/Sentiment & MG Distribution Lightweight Fishing Vest.png" alt=""/>
										<p>Although the market gap score for lightweight fishing vests was not significantly higher than the category average, the unusually low number of positive reviews combined with elevated neutral and negative feedback indicated abnormal customer dissatisfaction. This suggested a notable opportunity to address unmet customer needs within this product segment.</p>
									</div>
									
								<h3>Understanding the Market Gap</h3>
									<p>After identifying a market gap opportunity within lightweight fishing vests, it was time to investigate the specifics of the market gap language. Using the engine’s natural language processing capabilities, we uncovered the following critical market gaps among 30 ‘lightweight fishing vest’ products analyzed:</p>
									
									<h4>Zipper Placement & Functionality</h4>
										<p>In a vast majority of the product listings, customers mentioned a ‘backwards’ or ‘incorrect’ zipper. <a class="data-citation" href="https://sewingteam.com/are-mens-and-womens-zippers-on-different-sides/#:~:text=In%20Western%20cultures,customs%20and%20practices">This issue arises from fishing vest retailers procuring their products from international manufacturers, where zipper design standards differ from those in the United States.</a></p>
										<img class="cr-example-figure" src="images/sample-1-fv/backwards zipper.png" alt=""/>
									
									<h4>Zipper Quality</h4>
										<p>Similarly, customers frequently mentioned poor quality zippers. This issue was highly prominent and closely associated with customers that mentioned backwards zippers.</p>
										<img class="cr-example-figure" src="images/sample-1-fv/zipper quality.png" alt=""/>
									
									<h4>Inner Pocket Quantity</h4>
										<p>Customers across product listings consistently mentioned their desire for secure inner zippered pockets. This desire was strongly associated with vest practicality - wanting a reliable pocket to hold their phones and other small important items.</p>
										<img class="cr-example-figure" src="images/sample-1-fv/inner pocket quantity.png" alt=""/>
									
									<h4>Pocket Size & Accessibility</h4>
										<p>Lastly, small pocket size, and insufficient pocket access were frequently discussed by customers across the product listings. As we investigated the context behind the reviews that mentioned this issue, it became clear that across a vast majority of products, there were many pockets too small or too awkward to for consistent use.</p>
										<img class="cr-example-figure" src="images/sample-1-fv/pocket access.png" alt=""/>
							
							<h2>The Impact</h2>
								<p>By methodically analyzing fishing equipment products, we identified a prominent product opportunity within the industry: Lightweight fishing vests featuring high-quality zippers that adhere to Western design principles, along with accessible, spacious, inside zippered pockets.</p>
								<p>Conducting an analysis of this scale would not be feasible without the tools provided by the product analysis engine. By leveraging its data scraping capabilities and machine learning models, we analyzed thousands of customer reviews and identified key product attributes that consumers actively sought out but didn’t find.</p>
								<p>For e-commerce retailers, leveraging this fine-tuned product intelligence will directly satisfy customer needs, and make an unsuspecting product stand out in a crowded market.</p>

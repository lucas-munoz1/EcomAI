                    <h2>The Opportunity</h2>
                    <p>In 2024, retailers in the fishing equipment industry face a rapidly expanding market.&nbsp;During the Covid-19 pandemic, online sales of fishing tackle products – a subcategory of fishing equipment - grew by 40%. This surge contributed to fishing equipment revenues reaching $1.6 billion in the United States in 2024, a 6% increase from 2023.</p>
                    <p>To capitalize on this growth, we conducted a market gap analysis to identify a high-potential product within this niche. Our goals were:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To find a fishing apparel product which had a market gap (a significantly high number of customers expressing a need that has not been met)&nbsp;</li>
                        <li>To detail the specific product attributes of the discovered product that had not been served in the market.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="sample-analysis-margin">The following analysis is a small-scale representation of our product discovery service.</p>
                    <h2>Broad Market Gap Analysis</h2>
                    <p>First, a broad market gap analysis was employed to find fishing equipment products where large amounts of customer reviews had market gap language. Using the analysis engine to scrape product data, we collected and compared data from 30 product listings for fishing gloves, fishing lures, fishing vests, fishing chairs, and fish grippers.</p><img class="sample-analysis-image" src="assets/img/Sentiment%20&%20MG%20Distribution%20Fishing%20Vest.png">
                    <p>The product comparisons were made based on statistics generated from the sentiment analysis and text classification models. The primary metrics generated included the average number of positive, negative, and neutral customer reviews for each product category, as well as a 'market gap score,' which represents the percentage of customer reviews with market gap language.</p>
                    <p class="sample-analysis-margin">Our first observation was that fishing vests had a significantly higher than average market gap score, at 16.6%. Furthermore, an above-average number of neutral reviews indicated product adequacy, but room for improvement. Based on these two factors, fishing vests stood out as the leading contender for a product with a market gap opportunity.</p>
                    <h2>Targeted Market Gap Analysis</h2>
                    <p>The second component of this process was a targeted market gap analysis for fishing vest products. By repeating the previous process, but for fishing vest subcategories, we continued to narrow our focus until we could find distinct market gap opportunities. The products included in this analysis were lightweight fishing vests, fly fishing vests, fishing vest life jackets, and fishing vest backpacks.</p><img class="sample-analysis-image" src="assets/img/Sentiment%20&%20MG%20Distribution%20Lightweight%20Fishing%20Vest.png">
                    <p class="sample-analysis-margin">Although the market gap score for lightweight fishing vests was not significantly higher than the category average, the unusually low number of positive reviews combined with elevated neutral and negative feedback indicated abnormal customer dissatisfaction. This suggested a notable opportunity to address unmet customer needs within this product segment.</p>
                    <h2>Understanding the Market Gap</h2>
                    <p>After identifying a market gap within lightweight fishing vests, it was time to investigate the specifics of the market gap language.</p>
                    <p>First, we organized the customer reviews for 27 of the 30 lightweight fishing vest listings into one dataset. 3 product listings were found to be duplicate products and excluded from the dataset. Next, we used the text classification model to filter out reviews which did not contain market gap language.</p>
                    <p>Then, we used the engine’s natural language processing component to sort the customer reviews into groups based on similarity in language.</p>
                    <p class="sample-analysis-margin">Finally, we used the engine’s data visualization component to investigate the language within the customer review groups which revealed 4 critical product attributes contributing to the market gap. The following sections explain these attributes, and provide customer reviews taken directly from the product listings to demonstrate their relevance.</p>
                    <h4>Zipper Placement &amp; Functionality</h4>
                    <p>In approximately 52% of the product listings, customers mentioned a left-handed, ‘backwards’ or ‘incorrect’ zipper.&nbsp;This issue arises from fishing vest retailers procuring their products from international manufacturers, where zipper design standards differ from those in the United States.</p><img class="sample-analysis-image sample-analysis-margin" src="assets/img/backwards%20zipper.png">
                    <h4>Zipper Quality</h4>
                    <p>Similarly, in about 37% of all listings, customers explicitly stated problems with poor quality zippers. This issue was closely associated with customers that mentioned left-handed zippers.</p><img class="sample-analysis-image sample-analysis-margin" src="assets/img/zipper%20quality.png">
                    <h4>Inner Pocket Quantity</h4>
                    <p>In about 26% of product listings, customers explicitly mentioned their desire for secure inner zippered pockets. This desire was strongly associated with vest practicality - wanting a reliable pocket to hold their phones and other small important items.</p><img class="sample-analysis-image sample-analysis-margin" src="assets/img/inner%20pocket%20quantity.png">
                    <h4>Pocket Size &amp; Accessibility</h4>
                    <p>Lastly, small pocket size, and insufficient pocket access were explicitly discussed by customers in 37% of the product listings.</p><img class="sample-analysis-image sample-analysis-margin" src="assets/img/pocket%20access.png">
                    <h2>The Solution</h2>
                    <p>By methodically analyzing fishing equipment products, we identified a specific product with a market gap in the e-commerce fishing apparel industry:</p>

                        <p>Lightweight fishing vests are marked by mesh backings or other lightweight materials.</p>

                    <div class="sample-indented-text">
                        <h6>Market Gap Description</h6>
                        <p>At the time of this analysis, the current lightweight fishing vest offerings lack American style, high quality zippers. Customers repeatedly express discontent with left-handed zippers and state their desire for a zipper style they are familiar with. Providing a lightweight fishing vest with a right-handed zipper, particularly a Y2K, YKK, or other metal zipper, would satisfy a large portion of customers in a way that no other option currently does.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="sample-indented-text">
                        <p>The following list contains the product attributes contributing to the market gap, along with the percentage of product listings where the attribute was mentioned by multiple customers:</p>
                    </div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Backwards/reversed zipper (52%)</li>
                        <li>Poor quality zipper (37%)</li>
                        <li>Insufficient or awkward pocket access for inside pockets (37%)</li>
                        <li>Insufficient secure inside pocket space (26%)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Conducting an analysis of this scale would not be feasible without the tools provided by the product analysis engine. By leveraging its data scraping capabilities and machine learning models, we analyzed thousands of customer reviews and identified key product attributes that consumers actively sought out but didn’t find.</p>
                    <p>For e-commerce retailers, leveraging this fine-tuned product intelligence will directly satisfy customer needs, and make an unsuspecting product stand out in a crowded market.</p>
